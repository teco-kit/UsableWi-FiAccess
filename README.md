UsableWi-FiAccess
=================

This repository contains source code for different tag and context based authentication schemes for open Wi-Fi access.  The idea of those components is to provide usable and accessible WiFi Login elements.

The elements use the web components Web Components standard and can be easily included.
# Installation/Usage


To pull all dependecies call ```bower install``` 

You can use the components using [HTML Imports](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/imports/)

```
 <link rel="import" href="elements/login-manager/login-manager.html">
```

The login manager provides a adaptable interfaces that checks for the availability of other login options for the Unify Example. Use it like this

```
 <login-manager logins="simple qr" url="http://captive.portal"></login-manager>
```

Login elements currently supported include:
* QR-Code Login
* Simple Login

The module provides different authentication methods (password, QR-Code, etc) for login. Each of the authentication methods has been encapsulated in a web element that works as a HTML element.
Using the login elements

First, include the webcomponents library

<script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.min.js">

Next, you need to import the custom elements into the web page:

<link href="elements/elements.html" rel="import">

Once you've done this, if you need to use a normal login in your web project, you just use the normal login html tag

```
    <normal-login server="http://captive.portal"></normal-login>
````

Or if you want to use some QR code to login.

```
    <qr-login server="http://captive.portal"></qr-login>
```

To simplify the use of more than one authentification method, the module provides a login manager.

```
<body>
    <login-manager server="http://captive.portal" providers="normal nfc qr"></login-manager>
</body>
```

you only need to specify the authentication methods to be used and the module checks which methods are supported by the user's browser.

Normal Login

```
[[{"fid":"60","view_mode":"wysiwyg","fields":{},"type":"media","attributes":{"height":"1056","width":"1920","class":"img-responsive media-element file-wysiwyg"}}]]
```

QR Login
```
[[{"fid":"61","view_mode":"default","fields":{},"type":"media","attributes":{"height":"741","width":"1366","class":"img-responsive media-element file-default"}}]]
```



This is a rewrite of the original code that also included (planned to be ported):
* Audio context login
* WiFi Sheet Login
* NFC Login
